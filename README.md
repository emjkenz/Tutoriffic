## User Story
```
As a student using a learning platform, I want to view my attendance, modules, assignments, and a calendar displaying important dates, so that I can effectively manage and stay up-to-date with my academic progress.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
When I log in to the website, I should be able to access a dashboard that displays my attendance records, showing the number of classes attended and missed.
The dashboard should also list the modules I am currently enrolled in, providing essential information about each module, such as the name, subject, and instructor details.
I want to see a section in the dashboard that shows my assignments for each module, including their titles, descriptions, and due dates.
The calendar feature on the website should highlight the current date, helping me stay oriented in time while navigating the platform.
The calendar should also display the due dates of assignments, allowing me to manage my time efficiently and complete tasks on time.
The website's interface should be user-friendly, allowing me to easily access and view my attendance, modules, assignments, and calendar without any confusion.
I expect the information displayed on the dashboard and calendar to be accurate and up-to-date, reflecting the latest updates from my academic institution.
By having access to my attendance, modules, assignments, and a calendar with due dates, I will be able to effectively organize my academic responsibilities and stay on top of my studies, contributing to better academic performance and time management.
